# Overview

## Introduction

PayDollar PayGate is a powerful web-based online payment services platform, which provides secure,
multi-channel, multi-lingual and multi-currency payment services. It is used by many renowned
companies and organizations in the region.
This technical specification document prescribes the constituent parts of specification for integration of
an e-commerce web site with PayDollar e-commerce service, the on-line payment service by AsiaPay
(HK) Limited, by subscribed merchants of the service. This document has been created to ensure that
all technical specifications contain sufficient information to enable a merchant to design and modify the
codes of an existing on-line shopping architecture or software to cater for the payment â€“enabling service.
It also provides a checklist to enable the reviewers of specifications to conduct tests on the
functionalities of the integration.
There is an extra parameter section under each connection method. That section is especially designed
for 3DS 2.0 (Three Domain Secure 2.0). 3DS authentication is an additional security layer for card-notpresent transactions. With 3DS 2.0, it is aimed to achieve a better, stronger fraud-detection intelligence.
PayDollar PayGate facilitates merchant to connect to our network with great flexibility. Merchant can
choose one of the following integration methods, which will be described in detail in the document.
- Client Post through Browser (e.g. Shopping Cart)
- Direct Client Side Connection
- Server Side Direct Connection (e.g. IVR System, Mobile App)
Moreover, a list of merchant API functions will be also described in detail in the later section.
